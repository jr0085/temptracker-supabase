## Development Workflow Understanding

### Established Rules (from CLAUDE.md)
1. **Plan First** - Write tasks to todo.md before starting work
2. **Get Approval** - Check with user before beginning implementation
3. **Work Incrementally** - Mark todos complete as progress is made
4. **Keep Simple** - Minimal code changes, avoid complex refactoring
5. **Version Management** - Update ALL version locations consistently
6. **Final Review** - Add summary section to todo.md when complete

### Version Management Requirements
**Must update 6+ locations when making changes:**
- HTML title tag
- Main heading (h1)
- Console log message
- Flyout menu version display
- Manifest link
- Service worker registration
- Service worker cache names (3 locations)

### User Preferences
- **Single HTML File** - No framework splitting, self-contained application
- **Authentication Stability** - Never break working login (highest priority)
- **Simple Changes** - Prefer minimal modifications over complex solutions
- **Professional Quality** - Modern UI with reliable functionality
- **Clear Communication** - Explain changes made and reasoning

---

## Technical Implementation Patterns

### Code Organization
- **Global Functions** - Using `window.functionName` pattern for onclick handlers
- **Async/Await** - All database operations use modern async patterns
- **Error Handling** - Comprehensive try/catch with user notifications
- **State Management** - Global variables with proper cleanup and validation
- **UI Updates** - Always call relevant update functions after data changes

### Database Integration
- **Supabase Client** - Direct API calls with authentication headers
- **Real-time Subscriptions** - Cross-device synchronization
- **Row Level Security** - User and store data isolation
- **Error Recovery** - Graceful degradation when backend unavailable

### User Experience Standards
- **Loading States** - Professional spinners during operations
- **Error Messages** - Specific, actionable feedback with emojis
- **Notifications** - Toast-style success/warning/error alerts
- **Mobile Optimization** - Touch-friendly interfaces and responsive design

## Migration History Summary

### SharePoint Era (Legacy)
- **Challenges**: Complex authentication, DOM manipulation issues, slow performance
- **Limitations**: SharePoint-specific workarounds, brittle integrations
- **User Frustration**: Reliability issues, difficult maintenance

### Supabase Migration (v1.6.3 - v1.7.8)
- **v1.6.3-1.6.7**: Complete authentication system implementation
- **v1.7.x**: Core temperature tracking, equipment management, reporting
- **v1.7.8**: Final migration completion with export functionality
- **Success Metrics**: 100% feature parity + enhancements, dramatically improved UX

### Current State (v1.10.50)
- **Production Ready**: All core functionality complete and tested
- **Performance**: Fast, reliable, cross-device synchronization
- **User Experience**: Professional interface with comprehensive error handling
- **Maintenance**: Single HTML file, easy to update and deploy

## Recent Development History

### Major Completed Projects
- **Image Management** (v2.5.919) - Complete fix with memory leak prevention
- **Temperature Input Focus** (v2.5.920) - Enhanced UX for data entry
- **PWA & Settings** (v2.5.921) - Install prompts and location management
- **Export Functionality** (v1.7.8+) - PDF and Excel reporting
