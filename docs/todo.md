- [ ] Check current table structure and data format

#### Task 2: Add PDF Export Library
- [ ] Add jsPDF library via CDN for PDF generation
- [ ] Add jsPDF-AutoTable plugin for table formatting
- [ ] Keep it simple - use CDN links to maintain single HTML file approach
- [ ] Test library loading and basic functionality

#### Task 3: Implement PDF Export Function
- [ ] Create exportToPDF() function
- [ ] Generate PDF with header (store name, date range, report title)
- [ ] Add summary statistics (total logs, good/warning/critical counts)
- [ ] Create formatted table with all temperature log data
- [ ] Include equipment names, temperatures, status, logged by, timestamps
- [ ] Add proper page breaks for long reports
- [ ] Style PDF to match app branding

#### Task 4: Add Excel Export Library

- [ ] Keep it lightweight - only include necessary components
- [ ] Test library loading and basic functionality

#### Task 5: Implement Excel Export Function
- [ ] Create exportToExcel() function
- [ ] Create workbook with proper headers
- [ ] Add summary sheet with statistics
- [ ] Add data sheet with all temperature logs
- [ ] Format cells appropriately (dates, numbers, text)
- [ ] Set column widths for readability
- [ ] Apply basic styling (headers, borders)

#### Task 6: Test and Polish
- [ ] Test PDF export with various data sizes
- [ ] Test Excel export with various data sizes
- [ ] Ensure exports work on mobile devices
- [ ] Add loading indicators during export generation
- [ ] Add success notifications after export
- [ ] Update version to 1.7.9

### Technical Approach
1. **Use CDN libraries** to maintain single HTML file architecture
2. **Keep exports simple** - focus on data clarity over complex formatting
3. **Reuse existing data** from the temperature reports modal
4. **Add minimal code** - integrate cleanly with existing functions

### Expected Outcome
- Users can export temperature logs to PDF for printing/archiving
- Users can export to Excel for further analysis and reporting
- Exports include all relevant data: equipment, temperatures, status, timestamps, users
- Both formats work reliably on desktop and mobile devices

### Implementation Notes
- Keep changes minimal and focused on export functionality
- Don't modify existing report display logic
- Use the filtered data already shown in the reports modal
- Add proper error handling for export failures

## ✅ COMPLETED: User Dropdown Flyout Menu Fix - v1.7.8

### Problem Analysis
**CRITICAL ISSUE:** User flyout menu (dropdown) is appearing BEHIND the first two cards:
- Navigation tabs card (Temperature Log/Equipment buttons)  
- Store selector card ("Select Store Location")
- User cannot see dropdown content (Profile Settings, Sign Out options)
- Version number needs to be positioned in the header's white background area

### Root Cause Investigation
Current z-index hierarchy causing conflicts:
- Navigation tabs: z-index: 5
- Store selector: z-index: 10  
- User dropdown: z-index: 999999999
- **Problem:** Despite high z-index, dropdown still appears behind cards

### Plan

#### Task 1: Analyze Z-Index Stacking Context Issues
- [x] Identify ALL elements creating new stacking contexts
- [x] Check if parent containers are limiting z-index effectiveness
- [x] Document complete z-index hierarchy in application
- [x] Find which specific elements are covering the dropdown

#### Task 2: Fix User Dropdown Z-Index (PRIORITY 1)
- [x] Remove z-index from ALL cards that don't need to be on top
- [x] Set navigation tabs z-index to 1 (lowest)
- [x] Set store selector z-index to 1 (lowest)  
- [x] Ensure user dropdown container has proper stacking context
- [x] Add CSS !important overrides to force dropdown visibility

#### Task 3: Position Version Number in Header (PRIORITY 2)
- [x] Move version number inside header container (not absolutely positioned outside)
- [x] Position directly below user dropdown within header's white background
- [x] Match header's glass-strong background styling
- [x] Ensure visibility in both light and dark modes
- [x] Remove version from outside header area

#### Task 4: CSS Stacking Context Fix
- [x] Check for transform, opacity, or filter properties creating new contexts
- [x] Ensure header has proper position: relative
- [x] Add CSS rules to force dropdown above all other elements
- [x] Test dropdown visibility with !important declarations

#### Task 5: Test and Verify
- [x] Test dropdown appears above navigation tabs card
- [x] Test dropdown appears above store selector card  
- [x] Verify version number is visible in header white area
- [x] Check both light and dark mode functionality
- [x] Confirm no other UI elements are broken

### Technical Approach
1. **Remove competing z-index values** from cards that shouldn't be on top
2. **Force stacking context** by ensuring proper parent-child relationships
3. **Use CSS !important** to override any conflicting styles
4. **Position version in header** as child of header container, not floating outside

### Expected Outcome
- User can clearly see dropdown menu with "Profile Settings" and "Sign Out" options
- Version number is visible within the header's white background area  
- No z-index conflicts between UI elements
- Dropdown appears above ALL other page content

### Implementation Notes
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Don't break existing functionality
- Update version to v1.7.8 when complete
- Test thoroughly before marking complete

## ✅ COMPLETED - Authentication System Implementation (v1.6.3 - v1.6.7)

### Project Context
Successfully implemented complete authentication system for TempTracker Pro Supabase migration, transitioning from SharePoint to modern Supabase + Next.js architecture while maintaining single HTML file approach per user preference.

**Current Version:** 1.6.7
**Main File:** `C:\Developer\Sharepoint Webpart\TempTracker-Supabase\working.html`

---

## Completed Tasks ✅

### v1.6.3 - User Profile Display Fix
**Issue:** User profile showing "User" and "No store" after account creation despite proper signup
**Root Cause:** `updateUserDisplay()` only worked when `userProfile` existed, timing issues in profile loading
**Solution:**
- Enhanced `updateUserDisplay()` to use fallback data from `currentUser` when `userProfile` unavailable
- Improved `loadUserProfile()` with comprehensive error handling and fallback profile creation
- Added better logging and null checks for all DOM elements
- Fixed timing issues in profile loading sequence with always-called `updateUserDisplay()`

### v1.6.4 - Complete Password Reset Feature
**Added full "Forgot Password" functionality:**
- **UI Components:** "Forgot Password?" link in login form, dedicated reset form with instructions
- **Email System:** Secure reset link generation using Supabase Auth's `resetPasswordForEmail()`
- **Reset Flow:** Automatic token detection in URL, password update prompt, session management
- **User Experience:** Auto-login after successful reset, clear error messages, form switching
- **Security:** Token-based authentication, secure session handling, URL cleanup

### v1.6.5 - Authentication System Debugging & Enhancement
**Enhanced authentication with better error handling:**
- **Specific Error Messages:** Email not confirmed, invalid credentials, detailed error display
- **Enhanced Logging:** Comprehensive console logging throughout signup/login process
- **Debug Tools:** `debugAuth()` function for comprehensive auth status checking
- **Profile Management:** `refreshUserProfile()` function for manual profile refresh
- **Improved Signup:** Better user_store_access creation with detailed logging

### v1.6.6 - Default Store Selection Fix
**Issue:** Selected store during signup not persisting/loading correctly
**Root Cause:** `loadDefaultStore()` only checked for cached store object, not handling store ID lookups
**Solution:**
- Fixed `loadDefaultStore()` to handle both cached store objects and store IDs from database
- Added fallback logic to find stores by ID in loaded stores array when cache missing
- Enhanced logging throughout store selection process for debugging
- Added `fixDefaultStore(storeId)` function for manual store assignment
- Ensured stores are loaded before attempting default store selection

### v1.6.7 - Database Permissions & RLS Resolution
**Issue:** 401/400/406 errors preventing profile and store access creation
**Root Causes Identified:**
- `auth.uid()` returning NULL during signup process (RLS policy violations)
- Missing `active` column in `user_store_access` table
- Column name mismatch: code using `role` but table expecting `access_level`

**Solutions Applied:**
- **Database Schema Fix:** Added missing `active` BOOLEAN column to `user_store_access`
- **Column Mapping Fix:** Changed `role: 'employee'` to `access_level: 'employee'` in insert operations
- **RLS Temporary Workaround:** Disabled Row Level Security on all tables for testing
- **Enhanced Debugging:** Added comprehensive `debugAuth()` function showing all database states

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Architecture
**Database Tables (Supabase):**
- **`user_profiles`** - User information, default store preferences (`id`, `email`, `full_name`, `default_store_id`, `active`)
- **`user_store_access`** - Multi-store permissions (`id`, `user_id`, `store_id`, `access_level`, `created_at`, `active`)
- **`stores`** - Store locations and details

**Authentication Flow:**
1. User creates account with store selection
2. Supabase Auth creates user account
3. Profile created in `user_profiles` with `default_store_id`
4. Store access record created in `user_store_access` with `access_level: 'employee'`
5. Default store automatically selected and displayed on login
6. Users can switch between accessible stores via dropdown

### Key Functions Implemented

#### Enhanced User Display System
```javascript
function updateUserDisplay() {
    // Uses userProfile if available, falls back to currentUser data
    const fullName = userProfile?.full_name || 
                     currentUser?.user_metadata?.full_name || 
                     currentUser?.email?.split('@')[0] || 'User';
    // Updates all user display elements with null checking
}
```

#### Robust Profile Loading
```javascript
async function loadUserProfile() {
    // Try to load profile, create if missing, handle all error cases
    // Always calls updateUserDisplay() regardless of success/failure
    // Provides fallback profile data for reliable UI updates
}
```

#### Smart Default Store Loading
```javascript
async function loadDefaultStore() {
    // Checks both cached store object and store ID
    // Finds store by ID in loaded stores array if needed
    // Comprehensive logging for debugging
}
```

#### Password Reset System
```javascript
async function handlePasswordReset(event) {
    // Sends reset email via Supabase Auth
    // Provides user feedback and auto-returns to login
}

async function handlePasswordResetCallback(accessToken, refreshToken) {
    // Handles reset link clicks, prompts for new password
    // Updates password and logs user in automatically
}
```

#### Comprehensive Debugging
```javascript
async function debugAuth() {
    // Shows current user, profile, store selection
    // Displays database profile and store access records
    // Reveals authentication state and potential issues
}
```

### Database Schema Updates Applied
```sql
-- Added missing column
ALTER TABLE user_store_access ADD COLUMN active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;

-- Temporarily disabled RLS for testing (needs proper policies)
ALTER TABLE user_profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_store_access DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE stores DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Technical Debt

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS) Disabled - HIGH PRIORITY SECURITY ISSUE
**Status:** Temporary workaround in place
**Issue:** RLS policies fail because `auth.uid()` returns NULL during signup process
**Impact:** All authenticated users can access all data (security risk)
**Root Cause:** Timing issue where user exists but session not fully propagated to database context
**Required Fix:** 
- Research Supabase Auth session propagation timing
- Implement RLS policies that work with actual auth flow timing
- Consider database triggers for initial user record creation
- Re-enable RLS with working policies

### 2. Authentication Timing Dependencies
**Issue:** Profile loading depends on proper sequence of operations
**Current Workaround:** Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms
**Better Solution:** Implement more robust state management or service layer
